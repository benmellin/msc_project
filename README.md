# msc_project
A semester long research project into the properties of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs).

This project expanded on previous work completed by Dr. Raga Krishnakumar at Sandia National Laboratories.

The purpose of this project was to determine some of the genetic features that determine if a Mesenchymal Stromal Cell is antimicrobial or not.

My group was provided with mRNA data of ~9,000 MSCs, and experimentally determined labels of antimicrobial or non-antimicrobial. We sought to use statistical and computational methods better understand what made some MSCs antimicrobial, and what made some non-antimicrobial.


My contributions included:
- [A Leiden Clustering based Classification Method](leiden_experiment/Ben_seurat_experiment_leiden.md)
  - The purpose of using this cluster based classification method was to try to develop an
  understanding of the cellular features (i.e.Â gene expression
  signatures) that may underlie antimicrobial/non antimicrobial
  behavior.
  - This particular dataset is heterogeneous and high noise, which is why
  we hypothesize may be effective.
  - This methodology was suggested by Dr. Mansoor Haider.
